# HOSTELS-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
This is the project that was created to enable students book hostels around Muni University with django framework for python.
requirements for it to get working on your machine;
After setting up your environment, your database needs to know this,
As an admin, create users and if you want a user to be by default, dont give them any firstname
If you want a user to be a hostelowner, give him "owner" as firstname
If you want a user to be a dean, give him any other firstname apart from "owner"
With these, you can see different pages after logging in as different users known to be student, landlord/lady and dean

If you used my database schema as is, the admin user is Josh and password is Adm1n_.
Then the student, you can put Abah password Craxmx93449964
Then the hostelowner you can put Lucy Craxmx93449964
This is what you need to know to get the project working fine
